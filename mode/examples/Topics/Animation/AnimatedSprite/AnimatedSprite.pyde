Animated Sprite (Shifty + Teddy)
by James Paterson. 

Press the mouse button to change animations.
Demonstrates loading, displaying, and animating GIF images.
It would be easy to write a program to display 
animated GIFs, but would not allow as much control over 
the display sequence and rate of display.
