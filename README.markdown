# Python Mode for Processing #

Write real [Processing](http://processing.org/) sketches in Python.

  * Based on [Processing 3.0](http://processing.org/), and compatible with most [3rd party libraries](http://www.processing.org/reference/libraries/).
  * Source compatible with [Python 2.7.3](http://python.org).

Successfully passed tests on Mac OS 10.10 and Ubuntu 14.

## Quick Start ##

### Processing Development Environment ###

If you're looking to write Processing sketches in Python, your best bet is to use
Python Mode. The project is still in its early days, and documentation is lacking,
but there are many example sketches to get you started. In general, the Processing
reference works just fine for Python mode.

First, [download Processing](http://processing.org/download). Then, install
Python Mode:

<img src="http://py.processing.org/install.png"/>

Then try your first sketch:

```python
def setup():
    size(600, 600)
    colorMode(HSB)
    noStroke()


def draw():
    fill(0x11000000)
    rect(0, 0, width, height)
    fill(frameCount % 255, 255, 255)
    ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 20, 20)
```
If you are a beginner, it is a good idea to go through the [tutorials on our website](http://py.processing.org/tutorials/), and alternatively some [examples](mode/examples).


## Using Processing Libraries ##

Python Mode is implemented in Java, and is designed to be compatible with the existing ecosystem of [Processing libraries](http://processing.org/reference/libraries/).

Many libraries need a reference to "the current PApplet", and that's what
`this` is for. Of course, there's no such thing as `this` in Python; it's just something that processing.py provides for you for compatibility with such libraries.

If you find that some Processing library doesn't work as expected with processing.py, please let us know in the [bug tracker](http://github.com/jdf/processing.py/issues).

## FAQ ##

  * __How do I report bugs or request new features?__

    Please report any issue in the [bug tracker](http://github.com/jdf/processing.py/issues).

  * __How can I create a launcher for my sketch?__

    Add these lines near the top of your script:

        import launcher
        launcher.create()

  * __How can I use Ani, or any other library that modifies fields?__

    Some libraries such as [Ani](http://www.looksgood.de/libraries/Ani/) require you to specify a variable name for animation. Unfortunately they cannot access Python variables directly (and Java's built in classes are immutable).

    To solve this problem we instead create a mutable `PrimitiveFloat` object. This object has a field `.value`, which you can use for these purposes.

        import jycessing.primitives.PrimitiveFloat as Float
        x = Float(100.0)
        Ani.to(x, 200, "value", 50);  # "value" is the name of the Float's internal field

    In case you need other primitive values, please [let us know](http://github.com/jdf/processing.py/issues)!

  * __Why was this project created?__

    I ([Jonathan](http://MrFeinberg.com/)) recently gave a talk about Processing to a group of rather bright 8th-graders,
    as part of a computer-programming summer camp they were attending at my office.
    Their curriculum up to that point had been in Python, which is an eminently
    sensible choice, given the
    [pedagogical roots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_%28programming_language%29)
    of the language.

    The kids were really turned on by the demos--I showed them the
    [white glove](http://whiteglovetracking.com/), and
    [Golan Levin](http://flong.com/)'s
    [New Year's cards](http://www.flong.com/storage/experience/newyear/newyear10/)--but
    they were bogged down by Processing's C-like syntax, which really seems arcane
    and unnecessarily complex when you're used to Python.

    I shared my experience with Processing creators
    [Ben Fry](http://benfry.com/) and [Casey Reas](http://reas.com/), and they
    told me that, indeed, the original Processing was a fork of
    ["Design By Numbers"](http://dbn.media.mit.edu/), with Python and Scheme
    support hacked in. Support for a multi-lingual programming
    environment was always part of the plan, so they were enthusiastic
    about any new attempt at the problem.

    I was able to hack up a proof of concept in a couple of hours, and have
    managed to create something worth sharing in a couple of weeks. I was only
    able to do it at all thanks to the brilliant and beautiful
    [Jython](http://www.jython.org/) project.

    At the time of Processing's first public release, August of 2001,
    Jython was too young a project to be used in this way. But now, having done
    absolutely no work to profile and optimize, I can get hundreds of frames
    per second of 3D graphics on my linux box. So, kudos to the Processing
    project, and kudos to Jython!

Much of the work in achieving compatibility with Processing 3.x was
was done by Luca Damasco
(Google Summer of Code student), under the supervision of Golan Levin,
with additional support from the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry at Carnegie
Mellon University. Without Luca, the porject may well have died.
