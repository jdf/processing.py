Instructions for folks who want to contribute to processing.py itself.

Prerequisites:

	git - http://git-scm.com/downloads
	Java 7 SDK - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html
	Apache ant - http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

Recommended:

	Eclipse Standard - https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

Steps:

If you think you're going to want to submit your own work to processing.py,
you should start by creating a fork of processing.py on github. Let's say
you've done so, and that your fork can be found at:

  https://github.com/JRandomHacker/processing.py

I'll also assume you've uploaded your SSH public key to Github.  

  $ git clone git@github.com:JRandomHacker/processing.py.git
  $ cd processing.py
  $ ant test

This will download the processing.py git repository and run all of the unit tests.

If you want to modify the code, and you're an Eclipse user, you can "Import
existing project into workspace" a couple of times, once for processing.py
itself (which lives in the processing.py top level directory), and once for
processing.core, which you'll find in externals/processing.

Once you've imported those two projects, you should be able to run
test.jycessing.JycessingTests as a JUnit test.
