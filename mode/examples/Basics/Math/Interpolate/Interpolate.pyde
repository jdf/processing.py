"""
Linear Interpolation. 

Move the mouse across the screen and the symbol will follow.    
Between drawing each frame of the animation, the ellipse moves 
part of the distance (0.05) from its current position toward 
the cursor using the lerp() function

This is the same as the Easing under input only with lerp() instead.
