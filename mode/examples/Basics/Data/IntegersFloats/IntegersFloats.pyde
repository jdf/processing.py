Integers Floats. 

Integers and floats are two different kinds of numerical data. 
An integer (more commonly called an int) is a number without 
a decimal point. A float is a floating-point number, which means 
it is a number that has a decimal place. Floats are used when you 
need to approximate real numbers.
