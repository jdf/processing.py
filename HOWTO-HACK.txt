Instructions for folks who want to contribute to processing.py itself.

Prerequisites:

	git - http://git-scm.com/downloads
	Java 7 SDK - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html
	Apache ant - http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

Recommended:

	Eclipse Standard - https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

Steps:

If you think you're going to want to submit your own work to processing.py,
you should start by creating a fork of processing.py on github. Let's say
you've done so, and that your fork can be found at:

  https://github.com/JRandomHacker/processing.py

I'll also assume you've uploaded your SSH public key to Github.  

  $ git clone git@github.com:JRandomHacker/processing.py.git

You'll need my forks of processing and processing-video (at least until such time as
processing.py has been rewritten to be compatible with versions of Processing
> 3.0a5).

  $ git clone https://github.com/jdf/processing.git
  $ git clone https://github.com/jdf/processing-video.git

Then:

  $ cd processing.py
  $ ant test

If you want to modify the code, and you're an Eclipse user, you can "Import
existing project into workspace" a couple of times, once for processing.py
itself (which lives in the processing.py top level directory), and once for
processing.core, which you'll find in the directory where you've cloned
jdf/processing.

Once you've imported those two projects, you should be able to run
test.jycessing.JycessingTests as a JUnit test.

There are several Eclipse Run Configurations included in the processing.py
directory, which are essential for debugging the Python mode sketch runner,
which is an independent application, and which communicates with the Mode
stuff via sockets.

To run or debug the SketchRunner, launch the SketchRunner Run Configuration
from Eclipse's Java runner menu. Once it has started up, run the "Base - Sketch
Runner First" configuration. This sequence runs things backwards; normally the
Mode runs, and itself launches the SketchRunner.
