"""
 * Request Image
 * by Ira Greenberg ( From Processing for Flash Developers). 
 * 
 * Shows how to use the requestImage() function with preloader animation. 
 * The requestImage() function loads images on a separate thread so that 
 * the sketch does not freeze while they load. It's very useful when you are
 * loading large images. 
 * 
 * These images are small for a quick download, but try it with your own huge 
 * images to get the full effect.
