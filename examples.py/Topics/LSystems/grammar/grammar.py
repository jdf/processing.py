"""
grammar.py module by Martin Prout
Supports the parsing of both stochastic and non-stochastic rules
axiom/rules are evaluated by the produce function, which uses the __weightedRule function
to return any stochastic rule according to the input dict, the repeat function is used to repeatedly
iterate the rules in a recursive fashion.
Example Rules:

Non-Stochastic = { "A": "A+F", "G": "GG", "X" :"G-G"}

Stochastic = {"A" : {"BCD": 5, "C+C+C":10, "ACA": 40}, "B" : {"DE-F": 5, "CCC":10, "A[C]A": 40}}

The Stochastic rule may contain non stochastic elements, in the above example there are two stochastic, elements,
with keys "A" and "B". The stochastic rule is detected by checking the 'value' type is dict. The dict needs to of the
form "string substitution" as key with the weighting as value.  A test function is included for the test conscious or
skeptic.
