Instructions for folks who want to contribute to processing.py itself.

Prerequisites:

	git - http://git-scm.com/downloads
	Java 7 SDK - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html
	Apache ant - http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

Recommended:

	Eclipse Standard - https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

Steps:

If you think you're going to want to submit your own work to processing.py,
you should start by creating a fork of processing.py on github. Let's say
you've done so, and that your fork can be found at:

  https://github.com/JRandomHacker/processing.py

I'll also assume you've uploaded your SSH public key to Github.  

  $ git clone git@github.com:JRandomHacker/processing.py.git

You'll need my forms of processing and processing-video (at least until such time as
processing.py has been rewritten to be compatible with versions of Processing
> 3.0a5).

  $ git clone https://github.com/jdf/processing.git
  $ git clone https://github.com/jdf/processing-video.git

Then:

  $ cd processing.py
  $ ant test

If you want to modify the code, and you're an Eclipse user, you can "Import
existing project into workspace" a couple of times, once for processing.py
itself (which lives in the processing.py top level directory), and once for
processing.core, which you'll find in the directory where you've cloned
jdf/processing.

Once you've imported those two projects, you should be able to run
test.jycessing.JycessingTests as a JUnit test.
