Use the extract-64bit-opengl.py to extract native 64 bit libraries for opengl. Needs to be run from your home directory (assuming that is where processing.py is installed. A simple modification would adapt for use on Windows, where you need
the *.dll binaries in place of *.so binaries. This script backs up the original 32 bit binaries should you need them.

The files in the folder jedit facillitate the use of jedit as an ide for processing.py. The main file is PYP5.xml which is a  commando file (and requires the jedit console plugin), put that file in .jedit/console/commando/folder. This file expect that there is a bash or batch script called pyp5 on your path that runs processing.py. A template bash script is included, and Jonathan has provided a batch script.
Two *.bsh macro scripts are include one creates a new script template (also sets the jedit environment for python editing).
The second calls the commando file so you can run your script form the editor with a couple of clicks. Put these scripts in your .jedit/macro folder.
